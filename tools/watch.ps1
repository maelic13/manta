.SYNOPSIS
    Console-noise filter for long fastchess / weather-factory (SPSA) runs.

.DESCRIPTION
    Pipe a noisy match stream through this to (a) TEE the full output to a log
    file — nothing is lost, grep/scroll it for per-game detail — and (b) print
    to the CONSOLE only the meaningful lines: the periodic report / parameter
    blocks, errors, and any anomalous game finishes (time loss / disconnect /
    illegal / crash / forfeit). The per-game 'Started game …', normal
    'Finished game … {Draw / wins by adjudication}', and running 'Score of …'
    lines are dropped from the console so you can actually scroll back through
    how the result / the parameters progressed.

    Keep-by-default is deliberate: anything not recognised as per-game noise is
    shown, so SPSA parameter snapshots, weather-factory's 'Elo difference'
    lines, and any error all reach the console.

.EXAMPLE
    # SPSA — filter weather-factory's console, keep a full log:
    python main.py 2>&1 | pwsh ../watch.ps1 -LogFile ..\results\spsa_smoke.log

.PARAMETER LogFile
    Path for the full (unfiltered) log. Created if its directory is missing.
    Omit to filter without logging.

.PARAMETER Append
    Append to an existing log instead of truncating it. **Mandatory when
    resuming a multi-session SPSA**: without it every resume wipes the log,
    and with it the trajectory spans the whole run. This was a real data loss
    on Rarog — one 3,670-iteration tune retained only 2,584 iterations, the
    other 1,086 destroyed by resumes, and the trajectory is exactly what the
    tail-mean bake and the per-knob bake filter read. `spsa.ps1` passes this
    automatically on -Resume / -LaunchOnly.
